This component allows you to get autocomplete suggestions either from hardcoded suggestions set by application's FE or remote suggestions obtained from application's BE.

To use it with the hardcoded list of suggestions, just set the `suggestionList` after init:

```js
SuggestionInput.init "test-suggestion-input"
    |> SuggestionInput.setSuggestions suggestionList
```

If you wish to use it with remote suggestions, add a `remoteSuggestions` update option in your update function.

The type of `requestCmd` must be `String -> (RemoteData.WebData (List a) -> msg) -> Cmd msg`, where `String` is the request's query.

```js
SuggestionInput.updateWith
    [ SuggestionInput.remoteSuggestions { requestCmd = fetchSuggestions, requestMinInputLength = 3 } ]
```
