Don't confuse this component with **Search input**, this component only displays suggestions received from an application that uses this component. It should replace our current "autocomplete" inputs solution in Checkout that works exactly like this.

User enters something into an input -> app calls BE with the query -> app updates this component with received suggestions to be shown
