# Introduction

This is a storybook for our Elm design system. You can find all the
components which were already implemented in the design system itself under the
**Stories** tab in the left menu. You can use this tool to explore the components or tweak controls to see how each component looks or behaves in specific scenarios. You can also check if the components meets the accessibility standards thanks to the built-in **Axe a11y** addon.

Currently, the work on the design system is still
ongoing. We don't have all the components implemented yet and we are in a process of trying using already existing components in some of our apps to see if they are really suitable for our use-cases. The main goal in the future is to have these design system
components used in all of our Elm apps, leveraging [elm
packages](https://package.elm-lang.org/).
